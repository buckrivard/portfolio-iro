Bloc Jams and Bloc Jams Angular are mobile-first web-based Spotify clones. They give users access to a library of music with full playability on any browser. 

Bloc Jams served as my first introduction to writing production-ready, shippable code. The code base and design was provided by Bloc to give students, like myself, an opportunity to cut their teeth and get a feel for what it looks like to have a defined role in a front-end web development project. 

Throughout the project I viewed myself as a glorified Lego constructor. The blocks were built, the instructions were printed out, and I was told to create a real-life version of the photo on the box. Now, that may be a little overly humble. I was given opportunity after opportunity to make all the pieces play nice – that is to say, write real production code. It was as though your Lego kit was missing pieces and you were instructed to make it work anyhow. My role, then, turned to one of an engineer with a defined problem, and I was expected to produce a thorough solution. Now, that sounds a little better. But let’s get better still: ever heard of JQuery? Yeah, same, homie. It was the same moment I was putting the finishing touches on the original Bloc Jams, about to crack a well-deserved brewski, that I was told to give it a full-bore JQuery refactor. This refactor was even more intuitive to use than the vanilla JavaScript, and the hit to app performance was minimal. 

Much of the same was true of Bloc Jams Angular, the Single Page App iteration of Bloc Jams. Bloc Jams utilized simple hyperlinking and HTML files for its navigation and functionality, but adding the Angular framework breathed modern life into the platform using Model-View-ViewModel binding to create an ultra-responsive application powerful enough for even the most robust music libraries. These two iterations of Bloc Jams share much of the same code, but Bloc Jams Angular forced me into the nitty-gritty world of JavaScript frameworks. Using snippets of HTML from Bloc Jams, AngularJS’ efficient templates and controllers reached warp-speed responsiveness. This second, and more intense, refactor stretched my coding abilities and taught me an indispensable lesson in coding: never giving up. And never getting so angry that I destroy my laptop. 

Around halfway through this process I had the bright idea to invest in a whiteboard for my room. The days of lethargically staring at broken code on my laptop were gone. I was on my feet, excitedly pacing the room with dry-erase marker in hand, staring at broken code on my whiteboard instead. While that doesn’t sound like much of an improvement, the whiteboard led to the single greatest leap in my coding abilities to date. If I were to start over again, I’d waste no time typing code on my laptop without chicken-scratching it onto the whiteboard first.  

In blatant disregard of the DRY principle of coding, the result of this project was 3 of the exact same web apps. The ability to see vanilla JS, JQuery, and Angular versions of the same app side-to-side provides extremely valuable insight into the strengths, weaknesses, and differences inherent in each iteration. The lessons learned, both technical and personal, will be an invaluable foundation on which to build the rest of my web development career.
